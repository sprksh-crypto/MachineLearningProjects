## Summary

1. Classification Exercise: movement of the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar in the next hor based  on the previous hour's information for these securities.

2. Prototyping and Transfer Learning Exercise: detection of bird, squirrel and chipmunk presence; inference of bird type (of 358 types) from still images through two vision architectures classifying still images.

3. Integration of Vision and Generative Models: integrate a pipeling which, given a collection of natural images filters birds, squirrels and birdfeeders simultaneously; segments the resulting subsampled collection, inpaints squirrels to remove them, inpaints the bird to replace it with a bird of a different type, and develop a text query that produces images of a similar nature.

### Interface Notes:

All code was written using Python version 3.10.11 using Google's Colaboratory. Otherwise, code can be run via Jupyter Notebook.
